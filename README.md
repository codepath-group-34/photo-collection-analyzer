## Photo Collection Analyzer

### App Description
Productivity app which is a photo collection analyzer that allows you to search your images for the ones you want, and tells you if you have already saved an image to your gallery.


### App Idea Evaluation
Evaluate app across the following categories using the App Evaluation Protocol.

- Mobile: Making mobile photo galleries more accessible through creating a tool that allows the user to process images locally with an automated search engine in a time-efficient manner, rather than having the user use time to manually sort through their own photos
- Story: Friends and peers would react positively to the app as it would facilitate the searching and organization of their photographs, making the value of our app very clear to the user.
- Market: The market is pointed towards anybody who has a phone and adds value to those users since it would help them find that couple or specific photo they were exactly looking for. 
- Habit: The app's useage would be dependent on how frequent the user looks for specific photos. The user just consumes the app since they are only using it as a means to find an exact photo rather than take one. 
- Scope: This app would be challenging in the sense that it requires knowledge in machine learning unless we were to use some type of pre-existing API to help create this app.
